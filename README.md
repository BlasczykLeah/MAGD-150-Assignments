# MAGD-150-Labs
## Lab 1

This assignment is my first project in my MAGD-150 class. The theme of this project was buildings, so my idea was to create a city skyline. I like the way this turned out despite that it was my first project.

## Lab 4

This assignment's theme was Oceans of Pizza, which was very weird. My idea was to create a code that let the user create their own pizza. I did do much with the ocean part of the theme, but I did make the background blue with some lines to look like waves.

## Lab 5

This project is one of my favorites; the theme was television, and we just learned how to make the dots that look like the fuzziness of an old TV. I also learned how to use randomization that week, so the colors in the vase off to the left will always give a different result.

## Lab 6

Week 6's project is my favorite project. The theme for this lab was weather. I spent a lot of time and code making all of my raindrops, and then I added lightning when the image is clicked. I spent the most time on this project, and I am very pleased with the result.

## Lab 7

During this lab, we learned how arrays worked, but I still wasn't exactly sure how to use them. The theme was carnival, so I made a ferris wheel and used the arrays as the lights in the ferris wheel. I didn't use the arrays very efficiently, but I like how this project looks.
